    "\n",
    "**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is a game-theoretic approach to explain machine learning model predictions. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Explanations**: How each feature contributed to a specific prediction\n",
    "- **Global Insights**: Overall feature importance across the entire dataset\n",
    "- **Directional Impact**: Whether high/low feature values increase or decrease predicted cognitive load\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Model Context:\n",
    "- **Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "- **Prediction Task**: Binary classification of cognitive load (High vs. Low)\n",
    "- **Features**: Behavioral metrics, interaction patterns, and task-specific variables\n",
    "- **Goal**: Identify which behavioral signals most reliably predict cognitive load states\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation Guidelines:\n",
    "- **Positive SHAP values** → Push prediction toward \"High Load\"\n",
    "- **Negative SHAP values** → Push prediction toward \"Low Load\"  \n",
    "- **Magnitude** → Strength of the feature's impact\n",
    "- **Color coding** (in beeswarm plots) → Original feature value (red = high, blue = low)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📊 SHAP Bar Plot: Mean |SHAP| Values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top Drivers of Cognitive Load:**\n",
    "- **Budget Management Stress** → Highest impact; repeated price checking and cost adjustments strongly predict high load\n",
    "- **Constraint Violation Rate** → Invalid actions (breaking scheduling rules) indicate cognitive struggle\n",
    "- **Idle Time Ratio** → High idle periods reflect planning confusion or decision paralysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mid-Tier Contributors:** Scheduling difficulty, planning time ratio, multitasking load, and recovery efficiency reflect multi-step decision complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lower-Impact Features:** Form-related metrics, exploration breadth, and user traits show minimal discriminative power.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each dot represents one trial. Color indicates feature value (blue = low, red = high). X-axis shows effect on predicted load.\n",

    "**High Values → Higher Load:** Red dots on the positive side for budget stress, constraint violations, idle time, scheduling difficulty, and multitasking load all push predictions toward high cognitive load—these are \"struggle signals.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Values → Lower Load:** Blue dots on the negative side for recovery efficiency and form hesitation; high form efficiency reduces predicted load (matches low-complexity Tasks 1-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal Predictors:** Exploration breadth, rapid hovers, decision uncertainty, and traits cluster near zero with low predictive value.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model correctly identifies **planning difficulty**, **rule violations**, and **budget management struggles** as primary cognitive load indicators, aligning with NASA-TLX ratings and Task 3 complexity. Form interactions show minimal impact, reflecting their task-specific nature. No spurious features dominate—the model learns **theoretically-grounded patterns** for cognitive load detection."

Dominated by trials where `scheduling_difficulty`, `constraint_violation_rate`, and `budget_management_stress` are low, while `recovery_efficiency` and `form_efficiency` show stronger negative SHAP influence. Corresponds mostly to **Tasks 1 & 2** (low/medium load). Reflects efficient operation with fewer interaction conflicts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Clearly separated on the right side with higher PCA1 values. Contains primarily **Task 3** trials and high TLX (>60) samples. SHAP vectors show strong positive contributions from `constraint_violation_rate`, `budget_management_stress`, and `idle_time_ratio`, plus increased influence from `multitasking_load` and `drag_attempts`. Captures high-load behavioral signature: more mistakes, switching, constraint conflicts, and elevated motor/visual workload.\n",

    "Mean feature importance (averaged over LOUO folds) and standard deviation reflect how much each feature contributed to reducing prediction error in the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔥 Highest-Importance Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Constraint Violation Rate (0.211)** — Most important predictor; repeated invalid actions (overlapping schedules, impossible placements) indicate cognitive overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Budget Management Stress (0.175)** — Frequent price-checking loops and budget recalculations signal decision strain and resource overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Idle Time Ratio (0.117)** — High idle time reflects decision pauses, confusion, or planning delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Scheduling Difficulty (0.097)** — Failed drag placements and planning conflicts directly reflect Task 3 complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Multitasking Load (0.063)** — Excessive panel switching captures UI fragmentation and cognitive switching costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These top 5 features explain the majority of predictive power through: planning strain, invalid operations, budget uncertainty, context switching, and hesitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙ Mid-Importance Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planning Time Ratio (0.053)**, **Recovery Efficiency (0.053)**, **Mouse Entropy (0.034)**, and **Form Hesitation Index (0.032)** supplement high-level signals and help distinguish borderline cases (TLX ~55–62).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Low-Importance Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Form efficiency, drag attempts, filter optimization, exploration breadth, action density, decision uncertainty, and user traits (skill, cautiousness) contributed minimally. **Zip Code Struggle (0.0029)** had the lowest importance, aligning with Task 1's low-load nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest prioritizes **planning difficulty**, **constraint violations**, **budget stress**, **idle periods**, and **multitasking demands** as primary cognitive load indicators, strongly aligning with SHAP and TLX analyses. Lower-importance features (form metrics, personality traits) have minimal influence, demonstrating that the model focuses on **interaction struggle**, not incidental behavior."

    "## SHAP Clustering (PCA 2D)\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP explanation vectors projected into 2D PCA space and grouped using KMeans clustering. Each point represents a single trial, positioned based on **similarity of SHAP contribution patterns** rather than raw behavioral values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Cluster Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster 0 — Low/Moderate Cognitive Load Pattern (blue)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense, compact grouping on the left side of PCA space with stable SHAP signatures. Dominated by trials where `scheduling_difficulty`, `constraint_violation_rate`, and `budget_management_stress` are low, while `recovery_efficiency` and `form_efficiency` show stronger negative SHAP influence. Corresponds mostly to **Tasks 1 & 2** (low/medium load). Reflects efficient operation with fewer interaction conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster 1 — High Cognitive Load Pattern (teal)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly separated on the right side with higher PCA1 values. Contains primarily **Task 3** trials and high TLX (>60) samples. SHAP vectors show strong positive contributions from `constraint_violation_rate`, `budget_management_stress`, and `idle_time_ratio`, plus increased influence from `multitasking_load` and `drag_attempts`. Captures high-load behavioral signature: more mistakes, switching, constraint conflicts, and elevated motor/visual workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters emerge from **SHAP values** (model reasoning), not raw behavior. Clean separation indicates the model learned two distinct cognitive-behavioral regimes: one efficient and smooth, one conflict-heavy and resource-demanding. Provides strong **convergent validity** for metrics, TLX scores, and model predictions."
